    /// a WPF binding.  This property returns a custom type descriptor object which returns a
    /// property descriptor for each adaptable interface found on the DomNode.

    /// For example, to bind to an adaptable DomDocument on this DomNode, the XAML
    /// binding could look like this:
    /// 
    /// {Binding Path=As.DomDocument.IsDirty}
    ///

    /// types is used for the property path (in this case DomDocument). This could result in clashes
    /// if the DomNode has multiple similarly named adapters.</remarks>
