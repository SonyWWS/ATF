Release Notes (2012-11-20)
--------------------------
General Information

A new version 2.4.1 of SharpDX is available today for download.

This version is a maintenance version, mainly fixing several issues and improving the SharpDX Toolkit.

PrimitiveBatch from DirectXTk has been ported to the Toolkit. Also, there is a new convenient method to draw a full screen quad using GraphicsDevice.DrawQuad. See details about changes in the Toolkit below.

Note about using the Toolkit effect compiler (tkfxc.exe): You can use either the version from:

    The directory Bin\Net40Release if you have DirectX End-User Runtime June 2010 installed.
    Or you can use directly Bin\Win8Desktop-net40 which is shipped with D3DCompiler_46.dll
    Both versions can compiled shaders for all Windows (from Desktop, Windows RT and Windows Phone 8, except if you are using latest D3D11.1 features which are only available using d3dcompiler_46.dll)

As It was explained in a previous post, SharpDX is now accepting code contribution from the community. This release is integrating contributions from early contributors to SharpDX on github!

Concerning the support, I'm focusing my primary support for the core functions of the following API:

    Direct3D11 (not Effect11 framework), DXGI, D3DCompiler, XAudio2 and Audio part of MediaFoundation.
    The toolkit, the Toolkit.Graphics and compiler. The Toolkit.Game assembly has a lower priority (for non desktop platforms).

For other API, I strongly encourage the community to participate to fix bugs and/or add improvements, as they have a lower priority support now in SharpDX.

Concerning the forum, my personnal investement to respond to API usage has now a much lower priority, as explained in the "Changes in Support and Community" post.

Also, as indicated on the contact form, I will not respond to any private inquiry about SharpDX bug notice or API usage.

Release Notes (2012-10-31)
--------------------------
General Information

A new version 2.4 of SharpDX is available today for download with two major new features:

    Adds support for Windows Phone 8: This new version provides full access to WP8 DirectX from .NET (Direct3D11, XAudio2, MediaEngine). It allows you to add 3D content seamlessly integrated into your XAML DrawingSurface very easily. Like SharpDX for Windows RT, you can develop a game using Direct3D from .NET without using C++.
    New SharpDX.Toolkit (beta), a high level API that greatly simplifies access to Direct3D11 by providing a XNA like API with the full power Direct3D11. The toolkit allows you to develop a 3D application to target Windows Desktop, Windows RT or Windows Phone 8 using exactly the same code base.

This release includes also some breaking changes, enhancements, bug fixes...etc. Check the details below.

Windows Phone 8

Last year, SharpDX was released on Windows 8 Metro only one week after It was revealed. This year, we had the chance to get our hands on an early version of the Windows Phone 8 SDK, in order to port SharpDX safely and easily. SharpDX is proud to provide the full DirectX experience for .NET developers from Windows XP to Windows Phone 8 platform. This release includes:

    Supports for Direct3D11.1/DXGI API. The SharpDX Toolkit (see below) is also able to target this platform.
    Supports for XAudio2 API
    Supports for MediaEngine API
    Integration of Direct3D11 into XAML DrawingSurface (version using synchronized texture will be supported in next release)

This version has some minor restrictions and is not as perfect as we would expect due to some limitations in the Windows Phone 8 CLR Runtime that restricts ..NET usage. Mainly, WP8 doesn't allow to DllImport a function, so SharpDX on WP8 has the contraint to be platform dependent (x86, ARM) instead of being fully AnyCpu as previously. This is a known issue from WP8 CLR Team and will hopefully be fixed in next updates of WP8. Also, WP8 .NET is still suffering from some legacy WP7 Silverlight limitations that should also be fixed in next releases (for example, SharpDX cannot be used outside a Silverlight / XAML container, unlike on Windows RT where we can run an application without using XAML).

Apart from some restrictions of using a Direct3D11 API on a lower spec GPU, you can safely use the same Direct3D11 across Windows Desktop, Windows RT and WP8. This should open lots of exciting opportunities!
Toolkit for Games and Prototyping

SharpDX has been working hard to bring a higher level API on top of DirectX API and this now possible with SharpDX.Toolkit that is providing a Direct3D11 XNA like API. This beta version is now part of the distribution. If you are developing a Direct3D11 application, we highly suggest you to move to the Toolkit, as It provides a significant layer to ease the use of the Direct3D11 API and most importantly, to easily develop from Windows Desktop, Windows RT and WP8 using exactly the same code base!

The purpose of the toolkit is to target the DirectX and Windows platforms only and is not intended as a general cross platform game framework. The toolkit could be the perfect companion for:

    Developing multimedia or game applications using Direct3D11.
    Prototyping advanced Direct3D11 effects in C#.

This release includes the following features:

    Full coverage of the Graphics API:
        The toolkit provides a high level wrapper for each low level Direct3D11 classes: GraphicsDevice, Buffers (Vertex, Index, Structured, UnorderedAccess...etc.), Texture1D/2D/3D, TextureCube, RenderTargets, DepthStencilBuffer...etc. All these classes are handling creation of the resources and taking care of all ShaderResourceViews, RenderTargetViews, DepthStencilViews...etc. All Toolkit objects are castable to Direct3D11 raw objects.
        Provides all GetData/SetData for textures, buffers...etc.
        Provides an easy access to most of Direct3D11 Level 10-11+ features : Unordered Access (RWTextures, RWBuffers..etc.), Geometry Shaders, Tesselation...etc.
        All stock states are available through the GraphicsDevice.BlendStates / RasterizerStates / DepthStencilStates
        Texture and Image loading and saving (ported from DirectXTex and DirectXTk projects) supporting several image formats (DDS, JPG, PNG, BMP, GIF).
        A complete Effect System, handling the most complex part of efficiently binding shaders into the pipeline, update and upload constant buffers, bind all resources. This Effect system is also providing some advanced features, like constant buffer pooling, shader pooling (share a particular shader bytecode across different effects)...etc. The Effect system is introducing a new syntax for handling techniques and passes, but is still very similar to legacy Effect system. It is also supporting basic syntaxes for legacy FX 2.0 and FX 5.0 Effect systems.
        Port of all XNA StockEffects like the famous BasicEffect class.The API is compatible with XNA API, making it easy to port XNA samples to the toolkit.
        Port of SpriteBatch and SpriteFont from DirectXTk. SpriteFont is supporting font file format generated from DirectXTk MakeSpriteFont, or BMFont AngelCode (binary format). SharpDX provides tkfont.exe as well (which is currently only a port of MakeSpriteFont). SpriteFont in SharpDX is also suporting kernings! (currently only available with AngelCode BMFont).
    Supports of a modular ContentManager, XNA API compliant, but It provides plugin API for resolving streams (like loading resources not from the disk but from a zip or whatever) and pluggable readers (converter from binary streams to toolkit objects)
    Supports the XNA like Game class infrastructure that allows you to use the same code base across different platforms. This is abstracting creation of graphics devices, graphics presenters (swapchain), native windows (on Windows Form, on Windows RT)....etc. You don't have to write specific code to run your game in Windows Desktop and Windows RT, this is the same code!
    Four samples released that are running on Windows Desktop, Windows RT and Windows Phone 8
        HelloWorld, a simple application that shows a basic usage of Game class
        MiniCube, the popular SharpDX sample ported to the Toolkit, demonstrating how code is much simpler and less verbose than the raw API.
        SpriteBatchAndFont, displaying 5000 sprites and using SpriteFont to draw some texts.
        CustomEffect, shows how to use the effect system with a custom fx file.

As most of the effort in SharpDX development is now going into the toolkit in order to provides advanced features, you can expect the following features to be available in next releases of the Toolkit:

    Port of PrimitiveBatch from DirectXTk.
    Supports for Models/Mesh loading, animation, mesh rendering (usng assimp to support several popular formats).
    Supports for Audio (dynamic audio, wav sound player and media like library for MP3/WMA...etc).
    Supports for Input controllers (keyboard, mouses, touchscreen, gamepad... etc.)
    Visual Studio project templates.
    Possibly a simplified content pipeline manager integrated in VS

Unfortunately, there was a plan to provide a documentation of the Toolkit API for this beta, but there was not enough time left to finish and polish everything and to write this documentation, but unlike the DirectX API that has lots of books, resources on internet in C++, the toolkit needs defintely some documentation.
